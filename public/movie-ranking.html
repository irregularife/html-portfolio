<h1>The Best Movies According To Irregular</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies Of All Time!</h2>

<hr/>
<h3>KIMETSU NO YAIBA (MUGEN TRAIN)</h3>
<p>It was sooooo good and the animation was truly astounding, i truly enjoyed it except for the part where Rengoku died.</p>
<h3>AVENGERS ENDGAME</h3>
<p>This is still my favorite marvel movie till date, a cinematic masterpiece! The story, the action, the emotions, the suspense and the climax was worth the near 4 hour watch. i am still utterly gutted that Black Widow and Ironman died.</p>
<h3>SHERLOCK</h3>
<p>Although this is a series and not a movie, it deserves this spot as i was carried away by the ingenuity of how each episode was written and how the whole story unfolded and led to the series finale! Benedict Cumberbatch nailed and embodied the role of a narssisistic genius with a good heart and even better intentions.</p>
